# exemd [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/exemd.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/exemd)


> Pre-process markdown code blocks with external tools to produce html. Because we want to do everything with markdown right? 

## Install globally with [npm](npmjs.org):

```bash
npm i -g exemd
```


## Info

Website coming soon. 

## Usage

    exemd FILE [ -p | --pdf ] [ -r | --pure ] 
    exemd -h | --help 

    Options:
        -p, --pdf   Generate a pdf
        -r, --raw   Unfold and execute blocks, generate raw markdown
        -h, --help  

    Arguments: 
        FILE       markdown file name.

## Defaults

By default, `exemd` invokes `pandoc` to generate html. If you use `--raw` you will get a raw markdown with expanded blocks. 

*Note*: the `pdf` option does not work at the moment.

## Syntax

Each code block should begin with the language specifier followed by a bang (`!`) between brackets `{}`, e.g., if you have a diagram in the dot language:

    ```{dot !}

    diagram definition in dot...

    ```

This will invoke the `exemd-dot` plugin (which should be installed separately). The plugin will parse the block code by invoking the actual `dot` executable and the parsed `svg` will be put in the pasted into the final markdown (or html).

Depending on the plugin, you can also pass parameters (just as in org-mode)

    ```{dot ! plugin parameters string}

    diagram definition in dot...

    ```

## Plugins 

Look for npm modules prefixed with `exemd`. I wrote only `exemd-dot` and `exemd-ditaa` for diagrams. Feel free to provide plugins for R (like `kintr`) or other languages.
